# Rainfall Trend Analysis over Tamil Nadu (2000–2025)

This project uses Google Earth Engine (GEE) and CHIRPS satellite data to analyze spatiotemporal rainfall trends across all 32 districts of Tamil Nadu from 2000 to 2025. The analysis supports climate-based decision-making and sustainable resource management.

## 📊 Objectives
- Detect rainfall trends over time using statistical techniques
- Visualize spatial and temporal variations in precipitation
- Classify districts based on rainfall behavior and trends

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Google Earth Engine (GEE)**
- **CHIRPS v2.0 Rainfall Dataset**
- **Mann-Kendall Trend Test**
- **Linear Regression Analysis**
- **Javascript (for GEE scripting)**

## 📌 Key Outputs
- District-wise rainfall trend detection (2000–2025)
- Rainfall heatmaps and annual comparison visuals
- Classification of districts based on rainfall patterns
- Exportable charts and visual assets for reports
